# Apify utilities

Why another repo when we already have great [SDK](https://sdk.apify.com/) and many examples? This repo contains either 
- New features that may or may not land in the SDK once tested by time
- Simple functions for specific use-cases that are too specific for the SDK (like price parsing)

## Structure
This repo is split into two folders.
- `copy-paste` are functions that you can directly copy into your `utils.js` file and use them.
- `examples` are more complicated code samples that you might wanna adapt to your code

## How to use
This repo is not intended as a package. The code here will be updated and restructured as we please.

If you have any code samples that you would like to contribute, you are welcome to make a PR :)
